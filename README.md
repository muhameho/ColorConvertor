Color Convertor: 
Color Convertor is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help you convert from HEX to RGB with both formats (Form Properties, and Form Code), and pick colors directly from your screen. The application allows users to easily interact with color values, preview colors in real-time, and copy color codes to the clipboard for further use in various applications.

Features: 
Hex to RGB Conversion: Easily convert color codes from Hex format (e.g., #FFFFFF) to RGB format (e.g., 255, 255, 255).
RGB to Hex Conversion: Convert RGB values back into Hex format.
Color Picker: Select colors directly from your screen using the color picker tool. The picker updates live and displays the color in a preview panel.
Clipboard Support: Copy Hex and RGB color codes to the clipboard for quick reuse.
Minimized Mode: The app can be minimized (If you need to) while using the color picker, making it non-intrusive.
Preview Panel: A preview panel shows the color in real-time while picking colors from the screen.
