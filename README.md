# Color Convertor
Color Convertor is a simple yet powerful application designed to help you easily convert color codes between HEX and RGB formats, and even pick colors directly from your screen. Whether you're a developer, designer, or hobbyist, this tool simplifies your workflow and allows you to interact with color values seamlessly.

### üåü Key Features:
HEX to RGB Conversion: Convert HEX color codes (e.g., #FFFFFF) to RGB format (e.g., 255, 255, 255) with both formats (Form Properties, and Form Code).
Real-Time Color Picker: Pick colors directly from your screen using the built-in color picker tool. The preview updates live and shows the selected color in real-time.
Clipboard Support: Copy HEX or RGB color codes to your clipboard for quick and easy reuse in other applications.
Preview Panel: The preview panel provides a live update of the color you're selecting, ensuring you get the perfect shade every time.
Minimized Mode: If you're using the color picker tool, you can minimize the app to keep it out of the way while you work.

### üíª How It Works:
Hex to RGB Conversion: Simply input a HEX color code into the app, and it will convert it to the corresponding RGB values.
Color Picker: The real-time color picker allows you to select colors from anywhere on your screen. As you hover over different areas, the app captures the color and updates the preview panel with the selected color.
Clipboard Support: Whether you need to use the color in another application or share it with a team member, just copy the color code to your clipboard with a single click.
